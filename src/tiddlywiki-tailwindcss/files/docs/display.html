<div>
  When controlling the flow of text, using the CSS property
  <span class="inline">ðŸš€ display: inline</span>
  will cause the text inside the element to wrap normally. While using the
  property <span class="inline-block">display: inline-block</span> will wrap the
  element to prevent the text inside from extending beyond its parent. Lastly,
  using the property <span class="block">display: block</span>
  will put the element on its own line and fill its parent.
